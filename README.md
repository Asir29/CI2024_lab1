Lab1 for Computational Intelligence Course at Polito

The approach for the Set Covering problem has been understood from the lectures.
The metodologies used are : 
- Hill Climbing to generate and explore the solution space.
- A bit of Dynamic Adaptation of the strength of the tweak that favours now exploitation and then exploration
- 1 out of 5 axiom to change the strength of the tweak function

The file "set-cover-lab1.ipynb" lets the user choose between the different instances of the problem (executing only the part in which you are interested).

The coverage function was borrowed by colleague Andrea Mirenda, some suggestions for the parameters were given by ChatGPT
